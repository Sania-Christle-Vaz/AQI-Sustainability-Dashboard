# AQI-Sustainability-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard analyzing air quality trends across Delhi, Chennai, and Mandya (2022–2025), highlighting regional pollution patterns and sustainability insights using AQI, PM2.5, PM10, population density, and seasonal factors.
Sustainable Urban Air Quality Analysis: A Comparative Study of Delhi, Chennai & Mandya (2022–2025)
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of air quality trends across three distinct regions in India—Delhi (urban, high AQI), Chennai (urban, moderate AQI), and Mandya (rural, low AQI)—from 2022 to March 2025. The goal is to uncover how seasonal changes, population dynamics, and pollutant sources impact overall air quality and to draw actionable insights that can guide sustainable urban planning.

Objectives:
Analyze and compare AQI trends across rural and urban regions.

Study the seasonal variation of AQI and its correlation with PM10 and PM2.5 levels.

Examine the impact of population density on air quality across cities.

Develop insights that support sustainable air quality policies.

Create a visually interactive and analytical dashboard using Power BI.

Tools and Technologies:
Microsoft Excel: Used for data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis.

Power BI: For visualizing seasonal trends, pollutant contribution, population dynamics, and AQI category distribution.

DAX: Used for KPI calculations and AQI category classification based on WHO standards.

Key Insights:
Delhi has the highest average AQI (168.4), followed by Chennai (87.2), and Mandya (65.4).

Despite having a higher population, Chennai maintains better air quality than Delhi—indicating other contributors like vehicular emissions and industrial activity.

Mandya, being a rural region, shows significantly better air quality due to minimal urban pollution sources.

PM10 levels contribute more to the AQI than PM2.5 in all cities.

Seasonal analysis reveals:

Delhi’s AQI peaks in autumn, followed by winter.

Chennai’s worst AQI occurs in winter, followed by autumn.

Mandya shows the highest AQI in winter, followed by summer.

Cooler and stagnant air during winter months traps pollutants, worsening air quality.

WHO-standard-based AQI category distribution:

Delhi: Majority in "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"

Chennai: Majority in "Moderate"

Mandya: Majority in "Moderate" with a substantial portion in "Good"

Conclusion
Urban regions like Delhi require urgent air quality management policies to combat high pollution levels driven by population density, traffic, and industrial activity. Meanwhile, rural districts such as Mandya reflect the benefits of lower pollution sources and green environments. Sustainable policies focusing on emission control, urban planning, and green infrastructure are essential to improve air quality across India's cities.
